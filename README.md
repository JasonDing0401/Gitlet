# Gitlet
<br/>A version-control system is essentially a backup system for related collections of files. The main functionality that Gitlet supports is:
<br/>Saving the contents of entire directories of files. In Gitlet, this is called committing, and the saved contents themselves are called commits.
<br/>Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits. In Gitlet, this is called checking out those files or that commit.
<br/>Viewing the history of your backups. In Gitlet, you view this history in something called the log.
<br/>Maintaining related sequences of commits, called branches.
<br/>Merging changes made in one branch into another.
<br/>Basic remote commands that allow you to backup your own files and maintain multiple versions of them
